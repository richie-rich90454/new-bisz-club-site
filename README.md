# Basis International School Shenzhen Developers' Club New Club Site
The new BISZ club site available at [new.biszweb.club](https://new.biszweb.club), which is now only a redirect to the current site at [www.biszweb.club](https://www.biszweb.club).\
However, after the basic structure is done, this would be moved to [www.biszweb.club](https://www.biszweb.club), and the old one would be relocated at old.biszweb.club and eventually deprecated.
